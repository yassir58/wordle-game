# Features Implemented

 # Approach

- I employed React Context to manage the application's state, opting for simplicity given the nature of the state. To handle backend routes seamlessly, I utilized 'trpc.' For enhanced server-side rendering and optimal performance, I incorporated Next.js Server Components. Authentication was implemented using NextAuth with credentials serving as the primary provider.
